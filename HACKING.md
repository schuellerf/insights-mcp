# Insights MCP Contributing Guide

## Run

⚠️ Usually you want to just use the MCP server via a tool like VSCode, Cursor, etc.
so please refer to the [integrations](README.md#integrations) section unless you want to
develop the MCP server.

Also checkout `make help` for the available commands.

## Architecture

### Application Structure

The `InsightsMCPServer` acts as a unified server that mounts multiple specialized MCP toolsets. Each toolset extends `InsightsMCP` and provides tools for specific Red Hat Insights services.

### Deployment Flow

MCP clients (like VSCode or Cursor) communicate with the `insights-mcp` server, which in turn makes authenticated requests to Red Hat Insights REST APIs.

## Header-Based Authentication Architecture

The Insights MCP server supports **per-request authentication** using HTTP headers for HTTP and SSE transports, enabling multi-user scenarios.

### Authentication Modes

The server implements three authentication modes:

1. **STDIO with Environment Variables** (default):
   - Credentials: `LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_ID` and `LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables
   - Scope: Process-wide
   - Use case: Local development, single-user desktop integrations

2. **HTTP/SSE with Environment Variables** (development only):
   - Credentials: Same as STDIO mode
   - Scope: Process-wide
   - ⚠️ **NOT production-safe**: Server emits warning at startup
   - Use case: Development and testing only

3. **HTTP/SSE with Per-Request Headers** (production-recommended):
   - Credentials: `lightspeed-client-id` and `lightspeed-client-secret` HTTP headers
   - Scope: Per-request
   - ✅ **Production-safe**: Enables multi-user scenarios
   - Use case: Production deployments, multi-tenant services

### Credential Priority

When both environment variables and headers are available, the priority is:

1. Environment variables (if set) - used for all requests
2. HTTP headers (if environment variables are not set) - extracted per-request

This ensures backward compatibility while enabling new multi-user capabilities.

### Multi-User Architecture

For HTTP/SSE transports without environment credentials, the server:

1. Extracts credentials from request headers using `get_http_headers()`
2. Uses local variables (not instance state) to maintain thread safety
3. Passes credentials directly to OAuth2 token endpoint
4. Isolates each request's authentication state

**Thread Safety**: The implementation uses request-scoped local variables to avoid race conditions in concurrent multi-user scenarios.

### Security Considerations

- **Credential Masking**: All `client_secret` values are masked in logs (shows only first 10 and last 6 characters)
- **Production Warning**: Server emits `WARNING: THIS SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PRODUCTION!` when HTTP/SSE uses environment credentials
- **Transport Restriction**: Header-based auth only works for HTTP/SSE transports (not STDIO)

### Implementation Details

Key components for header-based authentication:

- **`InsightsOAuth2Client._get_credentials_from_headers()`**: Extracts credentials from HTTP headers with transport validation
- **`InsightsOAuth2Client.refresh_auth()`**: Implements priority logic and thread-safe token fetching
- **`setup_credentials()`**: Validates configuration and emits production warnings
- **`BRAND_CLIENT_ID_HEADER` / `BRAND_CLIENT_SECRET_HEADER`**: Dynamic header names based on `CONTAINER_BRAND`

## Important notes
* When changing some code you might want to use `make build-prod` so the container is built with
  the upstream container tag and you don't need to change it in your MCP client (like VSCode).

* Make sure you really restart VSCode or Cursor after changing the code, as their "restart" button
  usually doesn't use the newly built container.

* ⚠️ Moreover, when you start VSCode, make sure you hit the `▶️ Start` button of the MCP server,
  **before** you start chatting! Otherwise VSCode _caches_ the tool descriptions and you will
  end up with a chat context with the old tool descriptions!

## Testing/local OpenID Connect (OIDC)

For tests you can override `INSIGHTS_BASE_URL`, `INSIGHTS_SSO_BASE_URL`.


### Usage

See [usage.md](usage.md) for the usage of the MCP server.

### Using Python directly

#### Option 1: Global CLI tool (recommended for usage)
Install as a global CLI tool (lighter, no development dependencies):

```bash
uv tool install -e .
```

Then run directly:

```bash
insights-mcp sse
```

#### Option 2: Project environment (recommended for development)
Set up the development environment (includes development dependencies for testing, linting, etc.):

```bash
uv sync --all-extras --dev
```

Then run with `uv`:

```bash
uv run insights-mcp sse
```

**Note**: Use Option 2 if you need to run tests, linting, or other development tasks:
```bash
uv run pytest
uv run mypy src/
uv run pylint src/
```

Both approaches will start `insights-mcp` server at http://localhost:9000/sse

For HTTP streaming transport:

```bash
insights-mcp http
```

This will start `insights-mcp` server with HTTP streaming transport at http://localhost:8000/mcp

### Using Podman/Docker

You can also copy the command from the [Makefile]
For SSE mode:
```
make run-sse
```

For HTTP streaming mode:
```
make run-http
```

You can also copy the command from the [Makefile]
For stdio mode:
```
make run-stdio
```

### Additional info

You can set the environment variable `IMAGE_BUILDER_MCP_DISABLE_DESCRIPTION_WATERMARK` to `True` to avoid adding a hint to newly created image builder blueprints.


## Hosted MCP Server with DCR Auth (Beta)

The Insights MCP server can be deployed as a hosted service with OAuth authentication, enabling secure multi-user access without requiring users to manage their own service account credentials. This approach uses Dynamic Client Registration (DCR) to allow MCP clients to authenticate through Red Hat Single Sign-On (SSO) with their Red Hat accounts.

DCR support is built on FastMCP's `OIDCProxy`, which acts as a transparent proxy between MCP clients and Red Hat SSO. It presents a DCR-compliant OAuth interface to clients while translating requests to the upstream Red Hat SSO OAuth provider, which doesn't natively support DCR.

### Setup and Run

#### Required SSO Authentication

Before running the server with OAuth enabled, you need to register an OAuth application with Red Hat SSO:

1. **Register OAuth Client Application**:
   - Access Red Hat SSO at `https://sso.redhat.com`
   - Create a new OAuth2/OIDC client application
   - Configure the authorized redirect URI: `http://localhost:8000/oauth/callback` (or your custom host/port)
   - Request the following scopes for your client:
     - `openid` - Standard OIDC identity scope
     - `api.console` - Access to Red Hat Console APIs
     - `api.ocm` - Access to OpenShift Cluster Manager APIs
   - Save the generated `client_id` and `client_secret`

2. **Important Notes**:
   - The server validates that tokens contain ALL required scopes
   - By default, only `localhost:8000` and `127.0.0.1:8000` are authorized host/port combinations
   - To use a different host/port, update `SSO_AUTHORIZED_MCP_SERVER_HOST_PORTS` in `src/insights_mcp/config.py`

#### Required Environment Configuration

Set the following environment variables before starting the server:

```bash
# Enable OAuth authentication mode
export OAUTH_ENABLED=True

# SSO Client credentials (from Red Hat SSO registration)
export SSO_CLIENT_ID="your-sso-client-id"
export SSO_CLIENT_SECRET="your-sso-client-secret"

# Optional: Custom SSO base URL (defaults to https://sso.redhat.com)
export SSO_BASE_URL="https://sso.redhat.com"

# Optional: OAuth timeout in seconds (defaults to 30)
export SSO_OAUTH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=30
```

**Important**: When `OAUTH_ENABLED=True`, the server uses SSO credentials for the OAuth proxy. The traditional service account credentials (`INSIGHTS_CLIENT_ID`, `INSIGHTS_CLIENT_SECRET`, `INSIGHTS_REFRESH_TOKEN`) are not used in this mode.

#### Commands to Run the Server

**Using Python directly**:

```bash
# HTTP streaming transport
uv run insights-mcp http --host localhost --port 8000
```

**Note**: The server will log a warning if you specify a host/port combination that isn't in the authorized list, and will fall back to `localhost:8000`.

### The Working Logic

#### OAuth Proxy Architecture

The hosted MCP server implements a sophisticated OAuth proxy pattern that bridges the gap between MCP clients (which expect DCR support) and Red Hat SSO (which doesn't support DCR). Here's how it works:

**1. Client Registration (DCR)**:
- MCP clients discover OAuth endpoints via `.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`
- Clients attempt to dynamically register using the DCR endpoint
- The proxy accepts registration requests and returns the shared SSO client credentials
- Client redirect URIs (e.g., `http://localhost:55454/callback`) are validated against configured patterns

**2. Authorization Flow**:
- Client initiates OAuth flow by redirecting user to authorization endpoint
- Proxy creates a transaction mapping client details (PKCE challenge, redirect URI) to the flow
- Proxy redirects to Red Hat SSO using its fixed callback URL
- User authenticates with Red Hat SSO using their Red Hat account
- Red Hat SSO redirects back to proxy's callback with authorization code

**3. Token Exchange**:
- Proxy exchanges upstream authorization code for access/refresh tokens (server-side)
- Proxy generates a new authorization code bound to client's PKCE challenge
- Proxy redirects to client's original dynamic redirect URI with new code
- Client exchanges code with proxy using PKCE verifier
- Proxy returns upstream tokens to client

**4. API Authentication**:
- Client includes access token in requests to MCP server
- FastMCP's OAuth middleware validates token using Red Hat SSO's JWKS
- Proxy forwards validated requests to Insights toolsets
- Toolsets use token to authenticate with Red Hat Insights APIs

**5. Token Refresh**:
- When access tokens expire, clients send refresh requests to proxy
- Proxy forwards refresh requests to Red Hat SSO
- Updated tokens are returned to client

#### OIDCProxy Implementation

The `init_oauth_provider()` function in `src/insights_mcp/oauth.py` creates an `OIDCProxy` instance configured for Red Hat SSO:

```python
auth_provider = OIDCProxy(
    config_url="https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/.well-known/openid-configuration",
    client_id=SSO_CLIENT_ID,
    client_secret=SSO_CLIENT_SECRET,
    base_url="http://localhost:8000",
    required_scopes=["openid", "api.console", "api.ocm"],
    timeout_seconds=30
)
```

The proxy maintains minimal state for active OAuth transactions, PKCE challenges, and token mappings using FastMCP's pluggable storage backend. This enables horizontal scaling across multiple server instances.

#### Security Features

- **PKCE enforced end-to-end**: From client to proxy and proxy to upstream
- **Scope validation**: Tokens without required scopes are rejected
- **Redirect URI validation**: Only authorized patterns accepted (prevents open redirects)
- **Token security**: Refresh tokens stored by hash only
- **Single-use codes**: Authorization codes expire after one use
- **Cryptographic randomness**: Transaction IDs use secure random generation
