# Insights MCP Contributing Guide

## Run

⚠️ Usually you want to just use the MCP server via a tool like VSCode, Cursor, etc.
so please refer to the [integrations](README.md#integrations) section unless you want to
develop the MCP server.

Also checkout `make help` for the available commands.

## Testing

The majority of tests are automatically run by CI/CD pipelines or
locally by running `make test`.

The toolset LLM tests use the shared `mcp_llm_eval` module. Its API, scenario
data structures, execution behavior, and consumer fixture contract are
documented in [`tests/mcp_llm_eval/README.md`](tests/mcp_llm_eval/README.md).

Although there are tests to use the `main` code, to double check that
especially handing over environment variables and credentials
(in multiple ways) work, those are the use cases that should be working:

### STDIO Mode (see `make run-stdio`)
- Default configuration with credentials in environment variables
- Custom environment: `INSIGHTS_BASE_URL`, `INSIGHTS_PROXY_URL`, and `INSIGHTS_SSO_BASE_URL` set with credentials in environment variables

### Streaming HTTP Mode (see `make run-http`)
- Default configuration with service account credentials in header (`insights-client-id` / `insights-client-secret`)
- Default configuration with JWT Bearer token in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- Custom environment: `INSIGHTS_BASE_URL`, `INSIGHTS_PROXY_URL`, and `INSIGHTS_SSO_BASE_URL` set with credentials in header

### OAuth Mode (see `make run-oauth`)
- `OAUTH_ENABLED=True`, `SSO_CLIENT_ID` and `SSO_CLIENT_SECRET` set, credentials via OAuth client
- `OAUTH_ENABLED=True`, `SSO_CLIENT_ID` and `SSO_CLIENT_SECRET` set, with custom environment (`INSIGHTS_BASE_URL`, `INSIGHTS_PROXY_URL`, `INSIGHTS_SSO_BASE_URL`) and credentials via OAuth client

### SSE HTTP Mode (deprecated but some MCP clients still need this, see `make run-sse`)
- Default configuration with service account credentials in header or JWT Bearer token
- Custom environment: `INSIGHTS_BASE_URL` and `INSIGHTS_SSO_BASE_URL` set with credentials in header

## Architecture

### Application Structure

The `InsightsMCPServer` acts as a unified server that mounts multiple specialized MCP toolsets. Each toolset extends `InsightsMCP` and provides tools for specific Red Hat Insights services.

### Deployment Flow

MCP clients (like VSCode or Cursor) communicate with the `insights-mcp` server, which in turn makes authenticated requests to Red Hat Insights REST APIs.

### Session Cache and Token Management

For multiuser scenarios (SSE/HTTP transports with header-based authentication), the `SessionCache` component provides per-connection OAuth token caching to improve performance and reduce authentication overhead.

**Key features:**
- Cache key: `(session_id, credentials_hash)` ensures isolation between connections and credential sets
- Default TTL: 15 minutes with automatic expiration
- Periodic cleanup: Removes expired entries every 20 minutes
- Thread-safe: Supports concurrent access from multiple requests

**Implementation:** See [`src/insights_mcp/session_cache.py`](src/insights_mcp/session_cache.py)

**Used by:** `InsightsHeadersBasedClient` for SSE/HTTP transports when service account credentials are provided via request headers. JWT Bearer token authentication bypasses the cache since no token exchange is needed.

## Important notes
* When changing some code you might want to use `make build-prod` so the container is built with
  the upstream container tag and you don't need to change it in your MCP client (like VSCode).

* Make sure you really restart VSCode or Cursor after changing the code, as their "restart" button
  usually doesn't use the newly built container.

* ⚠️ Moreover, when you start VSCode, make sure you hit the `▶️ Start` button of the MCP server,
  **before** you start chatting! Otherwise VSCode _caches_ the tool descriptions and you will
  end up with a chat context with the old tool descriptions!

## Testing/local OpenID Connect (OIDC)

For tests you can override `INSIGHTS_BASE_URL`, `INSIGHTS_SSO_BASE_URL`.


### Usage

See [usage.md](usage.md) for the usage of the MCP server.

### Using Python directly

#### Option 1: Global CLI tool (recommended for usage)
Install as a global CLI tool (lighter, no development dependencies):

```bash
uv tool install -e .
```

Then run directly:

```bash
insights-mcp sse
```

#### Option 2: Project environment (recommended for development)
Set up the development environment (includes development dependencies for testing, linting, etc.):

```bash
uv sync --locked --all-extras --dev
```

Then run with `uv`:

```bash
uv run insights-mcp sse
```

**Note**: Use Option 2 if you need to run tests, linting, or other development tasks:
```bash
uv run pytest
uv run mypy src/
uv run pylint src/
```

Both approaches will start `insights-mcp` server at http://localhost:9000/sse

For HTTP streaming transport:

```bash
insights-mcp http
```

This will start `insights-mcp` server with HTTP streaming transport at http://localhost:8000/mcp

### Using Podman/Docker

You can also copy the command from the [Makefile]
For SSE mode:
```
make run-sse
```

For HTTP streaming mode:
```
make run-http
```

You can also copy the command from the [Makefile]
For stdio mode:
```
make run-stdio
```

### Additional info

You can set the environment variable `IMAGE_BUILDER_MCP_DISABLE_DESCRIPTION_WATERMARK` to `True` to avoid adding a hint to newly created image builder blueprints.


## Hosted MCP Server with DCR Auth (Beta)

The Insights MCP server can be deployed as a hosted service with OAuth authentication, enabling secure multi-user access without requiring users to manage their own service account credentials. This approach uses Dynamic Client Registration (DCR) to allow MCP clients to authenticate through Red Hat Single Sign-On (SSO) with their Red Hat accounts.

DCR support is built on FastMCP's `OIDCProxy`, which acts as a transparent proxy between MCP clients and Red Hat SSO. It presents a DCR-compliant OAuth interface to clients while translating requests to the upstream Red Hat SSO OAuth provider, which doesn't natively support DCR.

### Setup and Run

#### Required SSO Authentication

Before running the server with OAuth enabled, you need to register an OAuth application with Red Hat SSO:

1. **Register OAuth Client Application**:
   - Access Red Hat SSO at `https://sso.redhat.com`
   - Create a new OAuth2/OIDC client application
   - Configure the authorized redirect URI: `http://localhost:8000/oauth/callback` (or your custom host/port)
   - Request the following scopes for your client:
     - `openid` - Standard OIDC identity scope
     - `api.console` - Access to Red Hat Console APIs
     - `api.ocm` - Access to OpenShift Cluster Manager APIs
   - Save the generated `client_id` and `client_secret`

2. **Important Notes**:
   - The server validates that tokens contain ALL required scopes
   - By default, only `localhost:8000` and `127.0.0.1:8000` are authorized host/port combinations
   - To use a different host/port, update `SSO_AUTHORIZED_MCP_SERVER_HOST_PORTS` in `src/insights_mcp/config.py`

#### Required Environment Configuration

Set the following environment variables before starting the server:

```bash
# Enable OAuth authentication mode
export OAUTH_ENABLED=True

# SSO Client credentials (from Red Hat SSO registration)
export SSO_CLIENT_ID="your-sso-client-id"
export SSO_CLIENT_SECRET="your-sso-client-secret"

# Optional: Custom SSO base URL (defaults to https://sso.redhat.com)
export SSO_BASE_URL="https://sso.redhat.com"

# Optional: OAuth timeout in seconds (defaults to 30)
export SSO_OAUTH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=30
```

**Important**: When `OAUTH_ENABLED=True`, the server uses SSO credentials for the OAuth proxy. The traditional service account credentials (`INSIGHTS_CLIENT_ID`, `INSIGHTS_CLIENT_SECRET`, `INSIGHTS_REFRESH_TOKEN`) are not used in this mode.

#### Commands to Run the Server

**Using Python directly**:

```bash
# HTTP streaming transport
uv run insights-mcp http --host localhost --port 8000
```

**Note**: The server will log a warning if you specify a host/port combination that isn't in the authorized list, and will fall back to `localhost:8000`.

### The Working Logic

#### OAuth Proxy Architecture

The hosted MCP server implements a sophisticated OAuth proxy pattern that bridges the gap between MCP clients (which expect DCR support) and Red Hat SSO (which doesn't support DCR). Here's how it works:

**1. Client Registration (DCR)**:
- MCP clients discover OAuth endpoints via `.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`
- Clients attempt to dynamically register using the DCR endpoint
- The proxy accepts registration requests and returns the shared SSO client credentials
- Client redirect URIs (e.g., `http://localhost:55454/callback`) are validated against configured patterns

**2. Authorization Flow**:
- Client initiates OAuth flow by redirecting user to authorization endpoint
- Proxy creates a transaction mapping client details (PKCE challenge, redirect URI) to the flow
- Proxy redirects to Red Hat SSO using its fixed callback URL
- User authenticates with Red Hat SSO using their Red Hat account
- Red Hat SSO redirects back to proxy's callback with authorization code

**3. Token Exchange**:
- Proxy exchanges upstream authorization code for access/refresh tokens (server-side)
- Proxy generates a new authorization code bound to client's PKCE challenge
- Proxy redirects to client's original dynamic redirect URI with new code
- Client exchanges code with proxy using PKCE verifier
- Proxy returns upstream tokens to client

**4. API Authentication**:
- Client includes access token in requests to MCP server
- FastMCP's OAuth middleware validates token using Red Hat SSO's JWKS
- Proxy forwards validated requests to Insights toolsets
- Toolsets use token to authenticate with Red Hat Insights APIs

**5. Token Refresh**:
- When access tokens expire, clients send refresh requests to proxy
- Proxy forwards refresh requests to Red Hat SSO
- Updated tokens are returned to client

**Performance Optimization:**
- `SessionCache` reduces OAuth roundtrips by caching tokens per connection
- Cached tokens reused across concurrent requests from same client/credentials
- See [Session Cache documentation](#session-cache-and-token-management) for details

#### OIDCProxy Implementation

The `create_oauth_provider()` function in `src/insights_mcp/oauth.py` creates an `OIDCProxy` instance configured for Red Hat SSO:

```python
auth_provider = OIDCProxy(
    config_url="https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/.well-known/openid-configuration",
    client_id=SSO_CLIENT_ID,
    client_secret=SSO_CLIENT_SECRET,
    base_url="http://localhost:8000",
    required_scopes=["openid", "api.console", "api.ocm"],
    timeout_seconds=30
)
```

The proxy maintains minimal state for active OAuth transactions, PKCE challenges, and token mappings using FastMCP's pluggable storage backend. This enables horizontal scaling across multiple server instances.

#### Security Features

- **PKCE enforced end-to-end**: From client to proxy and proxy to upstream
- **Scope validation**: Tokens without required scopes are rejected
- **Redirect URI validation**: Only authorized patterns accepted (prevents open redirects)
- **Token security**: Refresh tokens stored by hash only
- **Single-use codes**: Authorization codes expire after one use
- **Cryptographic randomness**: Transaction IDs use secure random generation


## Logging and Compliance

### Debug Mode

Debug logging (`--debug` or `INSIGHTS_MCP_DEBUG=1`) includes identifiers such as client IDs and request metadata for troubleshooting. **Do not enable debug mode in production.** Debug logs may be retained by log aggregation systems; restricting debug to development and staging supports ISO 27001 (A.5.17, A.8.11) and ISO 27018 (PII protection).

### Logging and Monitoring

- **Default (INFO)**: Auth events, errors, and request metadata. Client secrets and PII in SSO claims are masked.
- **Debug**: Additional identifiers (client IDs, scopes, org_id). PII (account_id, username, email) remains masked.
- **Retention**: Operators should configure log aggregation and retention per their policy (ISO 27001 A.8.16).

### Deployment Responsibilities

For cloud deployments, the shared responsibility model applies (ISO 27017):

- **Red Hat**: API security, availability, authentication.
- **Operator**: MCP server deployment, credential protection, network isolation, incident response (see [README Security & Incident Response](README.md#security--incident-response-emergency-revocation)).

### AI Governance Scope

The MCP server is an AI-enabling component (connects LLMs to Red Hat services). Operators using it for AI workflows should include it in their AI governance scope (e.g., ISO 42001 AIMS) and risk assessments.
