# Red Hat Lightspeed MCP (formerly known as Insights MCP)

A [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server to interact with Red Hat Lightspeed services like the
 * [advisor](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_insights/1-latest/html/assessing_rhel_configuration_issues_using_the_red_hat_insights_advisor_service/index)
 * [hosted image builder](https://osbuild.org/docs/hosted/architecture/)
 * [inventory](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_insights/1-latest/html/viewing_and_managing_system_inventory/index)
 * [planning](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_lightspeed/1-latest/html/dynamically_creating_a_digital_roadmap_to_manage_rhel_systems/index)
 * [remediations](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_insights/1-latest/html/red_hat_insights_remediations_guide/index)
 * [vulnerability](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_insights/1-latest/html/assessing_and_monitoring_security_vulnerabilities_on_rhel_systems/index)

## Toolsets

See [toolsets.md](toolsets.md) for the toolsets available in the MCP server.

## Authentication

**Note**: Authentication is only required for accessing Red Hat Lightspeed APIs. The MCP server itself does not require authentication.

### Service Account Setup

1. Go to https://console.redhat.com → Click Settings (⚙️ Gear Icon) →  "Service Accounts"
2. Create a service account and remember `Client ID` and `Client secret` for later.<br>
   See below in the integration instructions, there they are respectively referred to as
   `LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_ID` and `LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_SECRET`.

### Required Permissions by Toolset

Different toolsets require specific roles for your service account:

- **Advisor tools**: `RHEL Advisor viewer`
- **Inventory tools**: `Inventory Hosts viewer`
- **Vulnerability tools**: `Vulnerability viewer`, `Inventory Hosts viewer`
- **Remediation tools**: `Remediations user`

### Granting Permissions to Service Accounts

By default, service accounts have no access. An organization administrator must assign permissions:

For detailed step-by-step instructions, see this video tutorial: [Service Account Permissions Setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvNcmJsbg1w)

1. **Log in as Organization Administrator** with User Access administrator role
2. **Navigate to User Access Settings**: Click Settings (⚙️ Gear Icon) → "User Access" → "Groups"
3. **Assign permissions** (choose one option):

   **Option A - Create New Group:**
   - Create new group (e.g., `mcp-service-accounts`)
   - Add required roles (e.g., RHEL Advisor viewer, Inventory Hosts viewer, etc.)
   - Add your service account to this group

   **Option B - Use Existing Group:**
   - Open existing group with necessary roles
   - Go to "Service accounts" tab
   - Add your service account to the group

Your service account will inherit all roles from the assigned group.

### ⚠️ Security Remarks ⚠️

If you start this MCP server locally (with `podman` or `docker`) make sure the container is not exposed to the internet. In this scenario it's probably fine to use `LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_ID` and `LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_SECRET` although your MCP Client (e.g. VSCode, Cursor, etc.) can get your `LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_ID` and `LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_SECRET`.

For a deployment where you connect to this MCP server from a different machine, you should consider that `LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_ID` and `LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_SECRET` are transferred to the MCP server and you are trusting the remote MCP server not to leak them.

In both cases if you are in doubt, please disable/remove the `LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_ID` and `LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_SECRET` from your account after you are done using the MCP server.

### Header-Based Authentication (HTTP/SSE Transports)

For HTTP and SSE transports, the MCP server supports **per-request authentication** using HTTP headers, enabling multi-user scenarios where each request can have different credentials.

#### Authentication Priority

The server uses the following priority order for credentials:

1. **Environment variables** (process-wide): `LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_ID` and `LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_SECRET`
2. **HTTP headers** (per-request): `lightspeed-client-id` and `lightspeed-client-secret`

#### When to Use Header-Based Authentication

- ✅ **Production deployments** with HTTP/SSE transports (recommended)
- ✅ **Multi-user scenarios** where different requests use different credentials
- ✅ **Security-sensitive environments** where credentials should not be stored in environment variables

#### When to Use Environment Variables

- ✅ **STDIO transport** (only option available)
- ✅ **Development environments** with HTTP/SSE transports
- ⚠️ **NOT recommended** for production HTTP/SSE deployments

#### Production Warning

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Using environment-based credentials with HTTP/SSE transports is **NOT production-safe**. The server will emit a warning at startup if this configuration is detected.

For production deployments with HTTP/SSE, use either:
- OAuth proxy mode (with `OAUTH_ENABLED=true`), OR
- Per-request header-based authentication

#### Example: Header-Based Authentication

```bash
# Start server in HTTP mode (no environment credentials)
podman run -p 8000:8000 --rm ghcr.io/redhatinsights/red-hat-lightspeed-mcp:latest http --host 0.0.0.0

# Make request with credentials in headers
curl -H "lightspeed-client-id: your-client-id" \
     -H "lightspeed-client-secret: your-client-secret" \
     http://localhost:8000/mcp
```

## Integrations

### Stage usage

Set the environment variables
* `LIGHTSPEED_BASE_URL`
* `LIGHTSPEED_SSO_BASE_URL`
* `LIGHTSPEED_PROXY_URL`
accordingly.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have `podman` installed.<br>
(Docker is fine too but the commands below have to be adapted accordingly)

You can install it with `sudo dnf install podman` on Fedora/RHEL/CentOS,
or on macOS use either [Podman Desktop](https://podman-desktop.io/) or `brew install podman`.

⚠️ **Note** if you use Podman on macOS, you sometimes need to set the path to `podman` explicitly.
E.g. replace `podman` with the full path. Should be something like

 * `/usr/local/bin/podman`
 * `/opt/homebrew/bin/podman`
 * …

You can find the path by running `which podman` in your terminal.

### VSCode

First check the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.

#### Option 1: One-click installation (easiest)

(Note: this uses the `quay.io` container image)

#### Option 2: Manual STDIO installation

For the usage in your project, create a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` with
the following content.

```
{
    "inputs": [
        {
            "id": "lightspeed_client_id",
            "type": "promptString",
            "description": "Enter the Red Hat Lightspeed Client ID",
            "default": "",
            "password": true
        },
        {
            "id": "lightspeed_client_secret",
            "type": "promptString",
            "description": "Enter the Red Hat Lightspeed Client Secret",
            "default": "",
            "password": true
        }
    ],
    "servers": {
        "lightspeed-mcp": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "podman",
            "args": [
                "run",
                "--env",
                "LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_ID",
                "--env",
                "LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_SECRET",
                "--interactive",
                "--rm",
                "ghcr.io/redhatinsights/red-hat-lightspeed-mcp:latest"
            ],
            "env": {
                "LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_ID": "${input:lightspeed_client_id}",
                "LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_SECRET": "${input:lightspeed_client_secret}"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Cursor

First check the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.

#### Option 1: One-click installation (easiest)

⚠️ Use **`Ctrl`/`Cmd`-click** to open in a **new tab**.<br>
Otherwise the tab will close after installation and you won't see the documentation anymore.<br>
[![Install with Podman in Cursor](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg)](https://cursor.com/en/install-mcp?name=red-hat-lightspeed-mcp&config=eyJ0eXBlIjoic3RkaW8iLCJjb21tYW5kIjoicG9kbWFuIHJ1biAtLWVudiBMSUdIVFNQRUVEX0NMSUVOVF9JRCAtLWVudiBMSUdIVFNQRUVEX0NMSUVOVF9TRUNSRVQgLS1pbnRlcmFjdGl2ZSAtLXJtIHF1YXkuaW8vcmVkaGF0LXNlcnZpY2VzLXByb2QvaW5zaWdodHMtbWFuYWdlbWVudC10ZW5hbnQvaW5zaWdodHMtbWNwL3JlZC1oYXQtbGlnaHRzcGVlZC1tY3A6bGF0ZXN0IiwiZW52Ijp7IkxJR0hUU1BFRURfQ0xJRU5UX0lEIjoiIiwiTElHSFRTUEVFRF9DTElFTlRfU0VDUkVUIjoiIn19)<br>
(Note: this uses the `quay.io` container image)

#### Option 2: Manual STDIO installation

Cursor doesn't seem to support `inputs` you need to add your credentials in the config file.
To start the integration create a file `~/.cursor/mcp.json` with
```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lightspeed-mcp": {
        "type": "stdio",
        "command": "podman",
        "args": [
            "run",
            "--env",
            "LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_ID",
            "--env",
            "LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_SECRET",
            "--interactive",
            "--rm",
            "ghcr.io/redhatinsights/red-hat-lightspeed-mcp:latest"
        ],
        "env": {
            "LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_ID": "",
            "LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_SECRET": ""
        }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option 3: Manual Streamable HTTP installation (advanced)

start the server:

```
podman run --net host --rm ghcr.io/redhatinsights/red-hat-lightspeed-mcp:latest http
```

then integrate:

```
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "lightspeed-mcp": {
            "type": "http",
            "url": "http://localhost:8000/mcp",
            "headers": {
                "lightspeed-client-id": "",
                "lightspeed-client-secret": ""
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Gemini CLI

First check the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.

#### Option 1: Manual STDIO installation
To start the integration create a file `~/.gemini/settings.json` with the following command:

```
{
    ...
    "mcpServers": {
        "lightspeed-mcp": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "podman",
            "args": [
                "run",
                "--env",
                "LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>",
                "--env",
                "LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>",
                "--interactive",
                "--rm",
                "ghcr.io/redhatinsights/red-hat-lightspeed-mcp:latest"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

#### Option 2: Manual Streamable HTTP installation (advanced)

start the server:

```
podman run --net host --rm ghcr.io/redhatinsights/red-hat-lightspeed-mcp:latest http
```

> [!NOTE]
> For podman machine on a mac you will need to set the host explicitly and expose the port
>
> ```
>   podman run -p 8000:8000 --rm ghcr.io/redhatinsights/red-hat-lightspeed-mcp:latest http --host 0.0.0.0
> ```

then integrate:

```
{
    ...
    "mcpServers": {
        "lightspeed-mcp": {
            "httpUrl": "http://localhost:8000/mcp",
            "headers": {
                "lightspeed-client-id": "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>",
                "lightspeed-client-secret": "<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Claude Desktop

First check the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.

For Claude Desktop there is an extension file in the [release section](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-mcp/releases) of the project.

Just download the `red-hat-lightspeed-mcp*.dxt` file and add this in Claude Desktop with

`Settings -> Extensions -> Advanced Extensions Settings -> Install Extension…`

### CLine with VSCode

First check the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.

First off, start the SSE server with `sse` argument:

```bash
export LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>
export LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>
podman run --env LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_ID --env LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_SECRET --net host --rm ghcr.io/redhatinsights/red-hat-lightspeed-mcp:latest sse
```

In the `CLine -> Manage MCP Servers` interface, add a new server name and URL:
`http://localhost:9000/sse`. It shall create the following config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lightspeed-mcp": {
      "disabled": false,
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "http://localhost:9000/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

Ensure the `type` is `sse` as CLine does not support `HTTP` transport yet.

### Generic STDIO

First check the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.

For generic integration into other tools via STDIO, you should set the environment variables
`LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_ID` and `LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_SECRET` and use this command for an
integration using podman:

```bash
export LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>
export LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>
podman run --env LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_ID --env LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_SECRET --interactive --rm ghcr.io/redhatinsights/red-hat-lightspeed-mcp:latest
```

It is the MCP API what is exposed through standard input, not a chat interface.
You need an MCP client with "agent capabilities" to connect to the `red-hat-lightspeed-mcp` server and really use it.

#### Claude Code

First check the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.

Claude Code requires a slight change to the podman command, as the host environment is not
available when it runs. The credentials must be copied into the configuration instead, which
can be done with the following command after setting `LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_ID` and
`LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables:

```bash
export LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>
export LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>
claude mcp add red-hat-lightspeed-mcp -- podman run --env LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_ID=$LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_ID --env LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_SECRET=$LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_SECRET --interactive --rm ghcr.io/redhatinsights/red-hat-lightspeed-mcp:latest
```

or just set the variables in the command directly:

```bash
claude mcp add red-hat-lightspeed-mcp -- podman run --env LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID> --env LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET> --interactive --rm ghcr.io/redhatinsights/red-hat-lightspeed-mcp:latest
```

To verify setup was successful, within the Claude terminal execute the command:
```bash
/mcp
```
If successful, you should see `red-hat-lightspeed-mcp` listed under Manage MCP servers with a green check mark connected status besides it.

## Examples

It's probably best to just ask the LLM you just attached to the MCP server to.
e.g.
```
Please explain red-hat-lightspeed-mcp and what I can do with it?
```

For example questions specific to each toolset please have a look at the test files:

 * [`image-builder-mcp`](src/image_builder_mcp/tests/test_llm_integration_easy.py#L20)
 * [`inventory-mcp`](src/inventory_mcp/test_prompts.md)
 * [`planning-mcp`](src/planning_mcp/test_prompts.md)
 * [`remediations-mcp`](src/remediations_mcp/test_prompts.md)
 * [`advisor-mcp`](src/advisor_mcp/test_prompts.md)
 * [`vulnerability-mcp`](src/vulnerability_mcp/test_prompts.md)

## CLI

For some use cases it might be needed to use the MCP server directly from the command line.
See [usage.md](usage.md) for the usage of the MCP server.

## Releases
There are two container images published for this MCP server.

 * `ghcr.io/redhatinsights/red-hat-lightspeed-mcp:latest`
 * `quay.io/redhat-services-prod/insights-management-tenant/insights-mcp/red-hat-lightspeed-mcp:latest`

They are both based on `main` branch and you can use either of them.

Insights-branded images are deprecated but still available for a while but might be removed in the future.

 * `ghcr.io/redhatinsights/insights-mcp:latest`
 * `quay.io/redhat-services-prod/insights-management-tenant/insights-mcp/insights-mcp:latest`
